          question: "Is rooftop solar completely free under government schemes?",
          answer:
               "Rooftop solar systems are not entirely free. Government schemes provide subsidies that significantly reduce the installation cost, but customers need to pay the remaining amount.",
     },
     {
          question: "What percentage of subsidy is available from the government?",
          answer:
               "Central and state governments provide subsidies based on system capacity and eligibility. The exact percentage varies according to the latest government policy.",
     },
     {
          question: "How can I apply for the central government solar subsidy?",
          answer:
               "The central subsidy is applied through the official solar portal during installation by an approved vendor, followed by inspection and documentation verification.",
     },
     {
          question: "Is state subsidy different from central subsidy?",
          answer:
               "Yes, state subsidies are separate and depend on state-specific policies. Some states offer additional benefits apart from the central subsidy.",

          question: "How much electricity does a rooftop solar system generate monthly?",
          answer:
               "Monthly energy generation depends on system size, sunlight availability, and location. On average, a 1 kW system can generate around 110–140 units per month.",
     },
     {
          question: "Does the standard rooftop solar package include batteries?",
          answer:
               "Most rooftop solar installations are grid-connected and do not include batteries. Battery backup is optional and can be added separately if required.",
     },
     {
          question: "Will solar power work during a power outage?",
          answer:
               "Grid-tied solar systems automatically shut down during power cuts for safety reasons. Hybrid or off-grid systems can provide backup power during outages.",
     },
     {
          question: "How is excess solar electricity credited to my account?",
          answer:
               "Excess electricity exported to the grid is measured through a net meter and adjusted in your electricity bill as per utility regulations.",
     },
     {
          question: "Which type of solar panels are generally used?",
          answer:
               "Most installations use high-efficiency mono PERC or bifacial solar panels suitable for Indian weather conditions.",
     },
     {
          question: "What warranty is provided for rooftop solar systems?",
          answer:
               "Solar panels usually come with long-term performance warranties, while inverters and other components have separate manufacturer warranties.",
     },
     {
          question: "What is the difference between system warranty and product warranty?",
          answer:
               "System warranty covers installation workmanship and performance, whereas product warranty applies to individual components like panels and inverters.",
     },
     {
          question: "What factors affect solar power generation throughout the year?",
          answer:
               "Seasonal changes, weather conditions, shading, panel orientation, and maintenance practices all influence solar energy production.",

     },
     {
          question: "How frequently should solar panels be cleaned?",
          answer:
               "Panels should ideally be cleaned once every 15–30 days, especially in dusty regions, to avoid energy loss.",
     },
     {
          question: "What should be used to clean solar panels?",
          answer:
               "Clean water and a soft cloth or sponge are sufficient. Harsh chemicals or abrasive materials should be avoided.",
     },
     {
          question: "How can I monitor daily solar energy generation?",
          answer:
               "Most modern inverters provide mobile apps or web dashboards to track real-time and historical power generation data.",
     },
     {
          question: "How does solar performance vary during different weather conditions?",
          answer:
               "Solar panels generate less power on cloudy or rainy days, while peak output is achieved during clear sunny conditions.",
     },
     {
          question: "Does shadow on a single panel affect the entire system?",
          answer:
               "Yes, shading can reduce overall output. System design and technologies like optimizers help minimize shading losses.",
